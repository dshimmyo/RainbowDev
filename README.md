Volumetric Rainbow Development

This is some on-going work I'm doing to create a volumetric rainbow in Unreal Engine 5. 
Although it doesn't require UE5 to work so, you can probably recreate it in ue4.
There are several versions of the rainbow being developed in different ways, it's basically a niagara system to generate a volumetric fog paired with a 3D shader to provide the rainbow colors and to help filter out all of the fog except for the cross-section which gives you the rainbow shape. It looks the best when it's lit by a light but it can be difficult to control and unintuitive but it looks cool when it fades in and out. An alternate method it so make it unlit or emmissive in which case it will always be visible as long as the fog fills a large enough volume. Anyway, it's here for you to examine and pick apart and hopefully learn from. I'll update it from time to time as I find ways to improve it and make it easier to control.
